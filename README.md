rails_templates
===============

Custom Scaffold templates for my rails projects.

(one day I'll make this a gem)


Usage
---------------------

1. Create a folder at rails_project_root > lib > templates
2. Copy the the erb and rails folder from this repository into this folder templates folder
3. Enjoy

If you're using [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) gem check the simple_form branch

### Compability:
* So far, I've used this templates with Rails 3.2.x only.
* simple_form 2.1
* Twitter Bootstrap 2
